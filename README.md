# 🌦️ Weather Analytics Dashboard (Python + BigQuery + Power BI)

This project tracks weather conditions across multiple cities, using a custom data pipeline from CSV to Google BigQuery, visualized through Power BI using Python and native visuals.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (for data cleaning, geocoding, and heatmap/boxplots)
- Google BigQuery (cloud data warehouse)
- Power BI (interactive dashboard)
- GitHub (version control & collaboration)

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- Temperature Distribution Across Categories
- Temperature & humidity trends over the time
- Dynamic weather condition segmentation (Hot / Cold / Moderate)
- Map by regions

## 📌 Highlights
- Time-series analysis with BigQuery SQL
- Custom DAX for categorizing temperature conditions
- Python visual integration in Power BI
- Data pipeline script included for automation

The project is a strong showcase of practical data pipeline skills, cloud data warehousing, and storytelling through interactive visualizations. This solution can be adapted for real-time monitoring, expanded to more cities, or scaled for larger environmental analysis.
